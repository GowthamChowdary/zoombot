# zoombot

Joins meetings at a given time

BEFORE YOU START--
1)You should be loggedin in into your zoom account from your default browser

2)Should have python 3 installed

3)Should have pyautogui installed ( install by using pip install pyautogui in command line)

If the script doesn't work, it is probably because of your screen resolution. Where it tries to click on join button. If that is the case, check the x,y axis position of the button on your screen and modify the auto.py file(i've commented where you have to modify)
